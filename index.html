<p> We offer in-depth guidance on full stack development, covering frontend and backend technologies, version control with Git, deployment using cloud services, and Agile project management. It includes practical projects, debugging tips, and career advice, making it an essential resource for aspiring full stack developers.</p>
</p>
<p>I will begin by discussing the key technologies and programming languages used in full stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and various front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. I will then move on to discuss the server-side technologies like Python, Java and Node Js, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Aws.
</p>
<p>Throughout the video, I will provide examples and code snippets to help illustrate how these different technologies are used in practice</p>
